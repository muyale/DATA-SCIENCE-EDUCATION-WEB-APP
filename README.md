# Data Science Education Web App

## Overview
This project aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly web application for data science education. Leveraging Falcon 7B Large Language Model (LLM) for the backend and Gradio for the user interface, the app offers a comprehensive platform for learning, practicing, and mastering key concepts in data science.

## Features
- **Interactive Learning Modules:** Engaging modules covering various topics in data science, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistical Analysis, and more.
- **Hands-On Exercises:** Practical exercises and coding challenges to reinforce learning and enhance skills.
- **Real-World Projects:** Opportunities to work on real-world data science projects, providing valuable experience and insight into industry applications.
- **Community Interaction:** Discussion forums, chat rooms, and collaborative spaces for learners to connect, share knowledge, and seek assistance from peers and experts.
- **Personalized Learning Paths:** Customized learning paths tailored to individual preferences, skill levels, and career goals.
- **Performance Tracking:** Progress tracking, assessments, and feedback mechanisms to monitor learning outcomes and identify areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used
- **Falcon 7B LLM:** Leveraged for natural language understanding, generating dynamic content, and providing personalized learning experiences.
